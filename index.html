                Physicists have unpacked the physics behind one of childhood’s favorite pastimes: blowing soap
                bubbles.
                Their experiments have revealed what’s the perfect size for a circular wand and the optimal wind speed
                required to blow bubbles that don’t pop. And while this may sound like a trivial study worthy of an Ig
                Nobel Prize, the study might actually help manufacturers make better sprays, foams, emulsions, and
                basically anything that has bubbles in it.<br><br>Studying bubbles has actually been a
                century-long
                intellectual pursuit that has helped scientists gain valuable physical and mathematical insights. For
                instance, a soap bubble is a perfect example of surface tension in action. It’s because of surface
                tension that bubbles are round — it’s this shape that determines a minimal surface area for a given
                volume and, hence, requires the least amount of energy to maintain. And it’s thanks to soap bubbles
                that
                some complex mathematical problems have been solved with real-world applications following not long
                after. For instance, equations that describe soap bubble formation have helped architects design roofs
                whose shape look impossible but are stable nonetheless. The Olympic Stadium in Munich is an
                illustrating
                example.<br>
                <h2 id="part2"></h2><span>Most recently, researchers at New York University (NYU) devised a
                  series of
                  experiments to help them blow the perfect bubble we’ve been chasing since we were kids. These revealed
                  that, essentially, there are only two ways in which bubbles can be made: one is by blowing a strong,
                  steady wind on a soap film, the other is by pushing with a gentle wind in an already inflated film to
                  raise its volume.</span>

                <blockquote>“This second method might explain how we often blow bubbles as kids: a quick puff bends the
                  film
                  outward
                  and thereafter the film keeps growing even as the flow of air slows,” said Leif Ristroph, an assistant
                  professor at NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences who led the study, in a a statement.
                </blockquote>

                The first method, on the other hand, is less widely used.<br><br>

                <blockquote>“This is used by the bubble blowers we see in parks in the summertime,” explained Ristroph.
                  “They
                  simply
                  walk, sufficiently fast, it seems, with a soapy loop of rope, which provides the relative wind needed
                  to
                  stretch out the film.”</blockquote>

                <h2 id="part3"></h2>
                Blowing bubbles is essentially a question of how a liquid film interacts with an imposed flow of an
                external fluid, in this case, air. However, for their experiments, the researchers used oil films
                suspended in flowing water and pushed through a wire loop wand. Using water instead of air allowed the
                researchers to control, measure, and observe the flows more accurately. What’s more, the observations
                matched the theoretical predictions for the film’s shape.

                So, if you’d like to make perfect bubbles, according to this study you’d better find a wand with a
                1.5-inch perimeter and gently blow at a consistent velocity of 6.9 cm/s. Any faster or slower, and the
                bubble will eventually burst; the same goes for the wand if it’s smaller or larger. On to you!
